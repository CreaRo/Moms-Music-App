# Moms-Music-App

An application I made for my mother. It downloads music from my github repo/online storage and downloads it locally for my mother to listen to.

---
The reason I built this application was because she finds it difficult to download music on her own, and hence, all she has to do is ask me to download the songs she wishes to listen to (she usually whatsapps me), I put them up on my github repo, and in her app, she has to click the download button, and voila! The music can be played, through the inapp music player.

I took around 4-6 hours to make the app, did it over the weekend, and it surely makes my life easier now! And now she's happy :D
